# Jeopardy-game-
Project Description
I made Jeopardy Game that has 4 types of questions and 3 levels of complexity for each type of question. Each level has its own
number of points. Each question has correct and incorrect answer for player to pick.
Score is collecting all points earned by player choosing correct answers

User Stories
As a player, I want to click on any card with points so I can read the question
As a player, I want to see two answers to choose from
As a player, I want to earn points if question is answered correctly
As a player, I want to see my score

Wire Frames!

Lots of DOM manipulation used to create each card and make the game work.
No installation instructions needed

I set Win function to 800 points to save time during the presentaion, but for real game it should be set to 2400 => total sum of all points if all questions answered correctly
